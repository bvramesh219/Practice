- On Feb She went out side house in the cold for getting ownership on my banck account. 
    - She removed Thali, and said didn't consider me husband since I gave access to account.
    - On the same day Sai went in the cold snowy weather with -17C with bare foot. She throw him and goe.
- She called me many times psycho 
- One day she throw Thali on my face and hit me.
- Because of her I am also suffering.
- One day she eat everything and didn’t even told me. At 10:30 I have empty stomach.
If I don’t close the door, what security you are providing for me and Kids.
I am always talk good and positive about Vehitha. Never reduces her level in my family or anywhere.
Her negative thought processing about
 - Sushma eggs breaking and others
- Jyeshta mother about Potta looking.

================
- Not a single day discussion went right direction.
- Pick a wrong time and wrong words
- Some time I don’t understand her response, it gives me clueless.
- Most of the time I am afraid to initiate discussion as I feel it would be take lot of energy, patience. Either I just agree 
- After discussion I feel so sad the way she treated me.
- So many times I get a feeling that my points are not considered or valued and she doesn’t even care.

*One time that discussion went good is with joint account and with lot of difficulty.

=========
She does not show interest while I am speaking. Uninterestedness. How can I carry on discussion?
She is the one who started saying to Sai => Bad about me.
* I am not sure why she is thinking I am not allowing my parents to help in work. That is wrong perception. My intention is generally they come to USA leaving behind every thing is difficult and at this point it would be better we go to them and serve them.

Finally What I need is
- To have healthy, constructive discussion with her with patience.
