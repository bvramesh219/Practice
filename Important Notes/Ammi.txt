- On Feb She went out side house in the cold for getting ownership on my banck account. 
    - She removed Thali, and said didn't consider me husband since I gave access to account.
    - On the same day Sai went in the cold snowy weather with -17C with bare foot. She throw him and goe.
- She called me many times psycho 
- One day she throw Thali on my face and hit me.
- Because of her I am also suffering.
- One day she eat everything and didn’t even told me. At 10:30 I have empty stomach.
If I don’t close the door, what security you are providing for me and Kids.
I am always talk good and positive about Vehitha. Never reduces her level in my family or anywhere.
Her negative thought processing about
 - Sushma eggs breaking and others
- Jyeshta mother about Potta looking.


====================On JAN-22 ===================================================================
I am showing saived to my parents as he is active. But he is not on shirt with towel wrapped.
While I am talking with my mom she come and shouted angrily, do you have Budhi while my mom on the call?
Similarly I am responding, then my mistakes are viewed in magnifying glass and attributed all the non healthy characterstics, intentions things like purushahankaram, destroying etc.. 
what she is done is natural and what I have done is natural given the situation.
Instead of working on understanding if she thinking as negative then it will destroy.
But she shown Baby to mamayya garu and Vadina even sleeping. 




==================JAN-21=======================================================================
- She is feeling and believing I am the most crual, useless and worthless person and procrasting that which is not correct.
    - She is taking guppedu negative responses and view those in magnifying lenses and doing developing those feelings.
    - My views and my opinions and my responses are natural just like her. I am also came from decent family and with values and educated only.
    - So many things I am patiently taking pain for her sake. And she is saying I am doing nothing. 
    - As she failing to recognize and I am also failing to recognize.
    - Today you guys know her and you guys are thinking she is not like this and automatically blame comes to me.
    - But what ever I did is for family future. 

Her main compliants are 
    - I am not taking care of family and Kids.
        - Yes. I gave priority to work. If things are job are not up to the standard how can I have peacefully focus on family.
        - Because of such stress in work I don't get my health correct, then 2 times abortion. After I joined and took care of my mental and physical health then she conceived and it stayed.
        - I will let you know every year what ever the challenges comes and it requires my attention. Nobody is there to guide me. It is always lonely fight.
            - 2017=> I can not attend my brothers marriage. That impact is they make him believe bad and I lost my brother.
            - 2018 => My Dad got heart attack and My Jeja died.
        - If she has one idea. Let her lead, let her tell me what to do, and help him to do as per her expectations.
        - I was focussing on changing jobs, Visa problems and everything and reducing weight. Because of that only my health improved and her pregnency stayed rt?
    - I am Angry
        - Yes. I am angry. That comes from genes. Every time it is battle. It is like fighting with biology.
        - Still I am doing what ever I can, meditation, exercise and spiritual practices and taking meditation also. And I am improving.
        - And those Anger situations are reasonable. The only outbursts are like when she doesnot understanding and completely making negative of every word I am saying. I got angry.


===============================JAN-20=====================
- She is taking negatively my natural responses and what ever I am supposed to do.
    - The suggestion that I have provided not to put more stress on Attayya and Mamayya, she considered I am not caring and not giving priority and importance to her. Where as I am caring that travel should be safe for Attayya.
- In last 2 years never happened a proper, constructive discussion.
    - When I said Sama, Dana=> She didn't understand what is Dana means. And said I am saying SUtti.
    - Then start blaming for everything and start verbal attack.

===============================================================================
- Not a single day discussion went right direction.
- Pick a wrong time and wrong words
- Some time I don’t understand her response, it gives me clueless.
- Most of the time I am afraid to initiate discussion as I feel it would be take lot of energy, patience. Either I just agree 
- After discussion I feel so sad the way she treated me.
- So many times I get a feeling that my points are not considered or valued and she doesn’t even care.
- 


*One time that discussion went good is with joint account and with lot of difficulty.

=========
She does not show interest while I am speaking. Uninterestedness. How can I carry on discussion?
She is the one who started saying to Sai => Bad about me.
* I am not sure why she is thinking I am not allowing my parents to help in work. That is wrong perception. My intention is generally they come to USA leaving behind every thing is difficult and at this point it would be better we go to them and serve them.

Finally What I need is
- To have healthy, constructive discussion with her with patience.

JAN 11
